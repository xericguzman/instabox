# Instabox

## Introduction

Today we'll be making Instagram.

Well, not the functionality... but the layout, at least!

Well, no, not the _whole_ layout, of course... but the layout of a profile page, anyway.

Well, okay, not the layout of even one profile page. But the top of one.

It's still gonna be hard!

But it'll be a lot easier with Flexbox.

## Your Assignment

Start out by forking this repository.

You'll be working on replicating this website:

## Guidelines

* All of the images have been given to you in assets
* You don't have to EXACTLY match the layout

## Some Resources

* CSS Tricks' excellent [run-through](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) of Flexbox. 

## Extra Stretch Goals

Try playing around with some CSS animations!

This can be done using the `@keyframes` CSS rule. Check out an example in this Stack Overflow post: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12638711/4762063.
